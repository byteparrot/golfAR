# golfAR

This project is a small showcase of what can be done with the AR plugin from http://vuforia.com/ inside Unity3D.

To try the game either download the sourcecode, insert a valid Vuforia API key and compile it or download the latest release and install the apk and use the attached image as the target of the camera.

Notice if you want to make your own project using this sourcecode, first read the Vuforia guidelines.
